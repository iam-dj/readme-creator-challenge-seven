# readme-creator-challenge-seven

## Description

The README creator app is a Node.js application that generates a README.md file for the user by prompting them with a series of questions using the Inquirer.js NPM package. The user can input details about their project, such as its name, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and more.

The app then takes the user's input and populates a README.md file with the information, including headings, sections, and formatting. The generated README file can be used to document and showcase the user's project, making it more accessible to potential collaborators, contributors, and users.

The app is useful because it streamlines the process of creating a README file, which can be a time-consuming and tedious task, especially for new developers who may not be familiar with the structure and content of a good README file. By automating the process with Inquirer.js, the app ensures that the generated README file follows a consistent and organized format, which can help to increase the project's visibility, usability, and overall quality.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
